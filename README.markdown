# A Flask Skeleton project with Sass and Coffeescropt

To get started, you'll need:


* [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/)
* [Coffeescript](http://coffeescript.org/)
* [Bower](http://bower.io/)

You can install the first through `gem`, and the latter two via `npm` (it's called "coffee-script", not "coffeescript").

Then:

* Clone this repository (`git clone git@github.com/adambard/flask-skeleton.git`)
* Use Bower to install dependencies (`bower install`)
* Use Pip to install the requirements from requirements.txt (`pip install -r requirements.txt`)
* Run the server (`python app.py`)

You can read more about it [here](http://adambard.com/blog/fresh-flask-setup/)
